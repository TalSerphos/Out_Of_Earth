# Out_Of_Earth

This science fiction novel follows Pelger, born and raised to lead humanity's space colonization efforts, from his birth until his mission comes to an unexpected end.
I am looking for co-writers to collaborate with me on writing the novel. If you liked what I wrote and care to join in, or just fork your own story out from it - feel free to reach out.
