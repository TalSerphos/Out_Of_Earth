# Out_Of_Earth

This science fiction novel follows Pelger, born and raised to lead humanities space colonization efforts from his birth until his mission comes to an unexpected end.

I am looking for co-writers to collaborate with me on writing the novel. If you liked what I wrote and care to join in - feel free to reach out.
